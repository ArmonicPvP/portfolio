      <p class="w3-large">&emsp;CIS 199 proved to be a comprehensive dive into object-oriented programming. This class
        focused on the use of C# for pratical application. Throughout the course, I developed an understanding of
        classes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance. This solid foundation allows me to create efficient programs
        that can handle various business tasks, like processing complex data inputs to generate a meaningful output
        for the end-user. In a business setting, these skills translate into developing software that can improve
        operational efficiency, data analysis, and customer interaction through intuitive user interfaces.</p>
      <ul class="w3-large">
        <li><strong>Problem Solving & Algorithm Design:</strong> I can now approach complex business problems
          systematically, breaking them down into manageable pieces to devise effective and efficient solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented Principles:</strong> Understanding encapsulation and inheritance means I can
          create modular code that is easier to maintain and update, which is crucial for business applications that
          evolve and scale over time.</li>
